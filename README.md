The RPN-Evaluator is a simple stack-based calculator designed to evaluate expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). This project implements basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using a stack-based approach, following the principles of RPN.

**Features**
Evaluates arithmetic expressions in Reverse Polish Notation.
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Uses a stack-based approach for computation.
**How It Works**
1. Input: The program reads an RPN expression from the user.
2. Processing: Tokens are pushed onto the stack or operated upon based on their type (numbers or operators).
3. Output: The final result is obtained by performing operations sequentially as tokens are popped from the stack.
